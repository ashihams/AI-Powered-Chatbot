ü§ñ AI-Powered Chatbot
A versatile and modern framework for creating intelligent, context-aware conversational agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project focuses on simplicity, extensibility, and scalability, allowing developers to quickly deploy a robust chatbot solution for various applications, such as enhanced customer support, interactive Q&A, and natural language data querying.

‚ú® Features
Intelligent Conversational Flow: Maintains context across multiple user interactions for coherent, human-like conversations.

LLM Agnostic: Designed to integrate easily with various LLM providers (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenAI, custom models).

Robust Deployment: Built with a clean Python structure suitable for deployment via web frameworks (Flask/Streamlit) or containerization (Docker).

Modular Architecture: Clear separation between the NLP core, API handling, and user interface logic.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Category	Technology	Purpose
Language	Python	Primary development language.
LLM/NLP	transformers, torch	Core libraries for tokenization and interacting with foundational models.
Web Interface	[Streamlit / Flask]	Please customize based on your interface choice.
Dependencies	requests, numpy, scipy	General utilities for API communication and data handling.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

git installed on your system

(Optional) A virtual environment manager like conda or venv.

1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and clone the project:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/ashihams/AI-Powered-Chatbot.git
cd AI-Powered-Chatbot
2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv 

# Activate the environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

Bash

(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure API Keys (If Applicable)
If you are using a commercial LLM API (like OpenAI or Anthropic), you need to set up your environment variable.

Create a file named .env in the project root (ensure this file is listed in your .gitignore!).

Add your API key inside:

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
# Or your chosen API key
üí° Usage
To run the chatbot application:

If using Streamlit (for web interface):

Bash

(venv) streamlit run app.py 
If using a standard Python console script (for testing):

Bash

(venv) python main.py
